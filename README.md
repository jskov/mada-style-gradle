# mada-style-gradle

A Gradle plugin that enables and configures plugins for java development as I prefer it (for dk.mada code).

If you are in disagreement about the style, you are most welcome to not use it.

The plugin can be removed without risking anything more than the style shifting away from my preferences.

## Activated plugins

## Development

$ ./gradlew -t publishToMavenLocal
